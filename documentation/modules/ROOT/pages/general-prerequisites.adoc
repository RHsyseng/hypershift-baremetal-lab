The following items are needed in order to be able to complete the lab from beginning to end:

* A base OpenShift cluster already running and a valid KUBECONFIG for it
* A default `StorageClass` available on the cluster
* Either available bare metal hosts or empty VMs for the worker nodes
* If using VMs:
** A valid and powerful enough hypervisor (typically Libvirt, although vSphere or oVirt can be used too.)
** https://kcli.readthedocs.io/en/latest[kcli] tool to create baremetal like VMs.
* A valid pull secret from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[here] that we'll keep in a file named `openshift_pull.json`
* `oc` and `git` binaries in your `$PATH`.
* The `openshift-install` binary downloaded from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest-4.13/openshift-install-linux.tar.gz[https://mirror.openshift.com] and available in your `$PATH`
* https://github.com/RHsyseng/telco-hypershift-baremetal-lab[The source repo] cloned locally


**NOTE:** You will need around 50GiB of RAM in order for OpenShift to successfully deploy on VMs. If those requirements are not met, you can still run through the lab but the final deployment might not succeed.
