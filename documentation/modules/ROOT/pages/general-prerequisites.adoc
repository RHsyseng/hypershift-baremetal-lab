The following items are needed in order to be able to complete the lab from beginning to end:

* A base OpenShift cluster already running and a valid KUBECONFIG for it
* A default `StorageClass` available on the cluster
* Either available bare metal hosts or empty VMs for the worker nodes
* If using VMs:
** A valid and powerful enough hypervisor (typically Libvirt, although vSphere or oVirt can be used too.)
** https://kcli.readthedocs.io/en/latest[kcli] tool to create baremetal like VMs.
* A valid pull secret from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret[here] that we'll keep in a file named `openshift_pull.json`
* `oc` and `git` binaries in your path.
* The `openshift-install` binary downloaded from https://mirror.openshift.com[https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/latest-4.13/openshift-install-linux-4.13.0.tar.gz] and available in the path
* https://github.com/RHsyseng/teldownloaded-hypershift-baremetal-lab[The sourhift to successfully deploy on VMS. If those requirements are not met, you can still run but the final deployment might not succeed.
