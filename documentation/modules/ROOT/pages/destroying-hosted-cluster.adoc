== Destroying the Hosted Cluster from the Web Console

1. Access the https://console-openshift-console.apps.management.hypershift.lab/[OpenShift Console] and login with the OpenShift admin credentials you got in the lab's email.
2. On the top bar, next to the Red Hat OpenShift logo, make sure `All Clusters` is selected. This will show us the `MultiCloud` console.
3. Click on the cluster named `hosted`, that will get you to the cluster view. Click on `Actions` -> `Destroy cluster`.
