== Red Hat Lab - Telco HyperShift Baremetal

(missing an official link to that product/documentation)

This hands-on lab will provide you with instructions so you can deploy a Hypershift cluster. The goal is to help you understand Hypershift internals, its value proposition, and make sure you can easily replicate the workflow.

Although other platform types can be used to deploy a Hypershift cluster (AWS or Kubevirt in particular), we will focus on the agent provider (what is that? agent-based installer?), as it's the recommended way to deploy a cluster with bare metal workers.

IMPORTANT: This is not an official Red Hat Training. Please contact with your Red Hat representative if you want more information about Training or Guidelines about this topic / product.
