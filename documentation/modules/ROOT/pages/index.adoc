== Red Hat Lab - Hosted Control Planes on Baremetal

This hands-on lab will provide you with instructions so you can deploy a Hosted cluster. The goal is to help you understand Hosted Control Planes internals, its value proposition, and make sure you can easily replicate the workflow.

Although other platform types can be used to deploy a Hosted Cluster (AWS or Kubevirt in particular), we will focus on the agent provider, as it's the recommended way to deploy a cluster with bare metal workers.

IMPORTANT: This is not an official Red Hat Training. Please contact with your Red Hat representative if you want more information about Training or Guidelines about this topic / product.
